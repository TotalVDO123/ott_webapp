# Developer guidelines

## When working on this project, keep these in mind:

- Use `yarn` to install dependencies
- Run tests through `yarn test`
- Start the project using `yarn start`

## Sentry Setup and Configuration

### Integrating Sentry

Sentry is integrated into this project to track and monitor errors, as well as performance issues. To ensure that Sentry is properly configured and working as expected, follow the steps below:

- Environment Variables:  
  Ensure that your .env.<mode> files include the following Sentry-related environment variables:  
  APP_SENTRY_DSN=Your_Sentry_DSN  
  APP_SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=Your_Sentry_Auth_Token  
  APP_SENTRY_TRACE_RATE=Trace rate for performance monitoring  
  APP_SENTRY_ORG_NAME=Your_Sentry_ORG_Name  
  APP_SENTRY_PROJ_NAME=Your_Sentry_Project_Name  
  <em>These variables are essential for Sentry to function correctly and should be kept secure.</em>

- Running the Project:  
  Use the following commands to install dependencies, run tests, and start the project, with Sentry automatically configured:
  Install dependencies: yarn  
  Run tests: yarn test  
  Start the project: yarn start

- Source Maps:  
  Source maps are configured to be generated during the build process to allow Sentry to provide readable stack traces.
  When building the project, the source maps will be automatically uploaded to Sentry if the correct environment variables are set.

- Error Monitoring:  
  Sentry captures unhandled errors and sends detailed reports, including stack traces, to help in debugging.
  Review the Sentry dashboard regularly to monitor the health of the application.

- Performance Monitoring:  
  Sentry is also configured for performance monitoring. Ensure that the trace rate is appropriately set in the environment variables.

## Adding Sentry to New Features

When adding new features or making significant changes to the code:

- Error Handling:  
  Ensure that errors are properly captured and logged using Sentry.
- Custom Error Classes:  
  If you define custom error classes, integrate them with Sentry for better tracking.
- Performance Considerations:  
  For critical paths, consider adding custom performance monitoring using Sentryâ€™s APIs.
